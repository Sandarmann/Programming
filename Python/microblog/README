So check it here is what we got going on:

we have the directory:

microblog/
	app/
		static/
		template/
		__init__.py
		views.py
	tmp/
	run.py
	README

Then we got the setup we have the virtual environment (Which I learned is just a folder that is created when invoking python -m venv NAME that contains all the necessary information for a wholly seperate python env)

Anyways I am doing the tutorial here:
