yo Al it's ya boiiiii

Anyways this project was to illustrate the use of Flask as a Web Server client

you have the main app.py which you must make executable in order to run the server.

Anyways Flask allows us to sumplify the process of intercepting requests and stuff. Also this shows you the idea of implementing a JSON like database. Which is just for an example so don't use this format outside the program.

But it also gives you an idea fo the type of responses you will need to make as well as modules that you will be using.


I will be doing the microblog tutorial after all as well...

Also remember to make a virtual environment for when you want to test things. The way we got flask input in here was by doing

python(3) -m venv flask which makes the flask directory


Then there is curl which comes with mac but it allows you to simulate a request like GET/POST/PUT/DELETE etc... pretty awesome
