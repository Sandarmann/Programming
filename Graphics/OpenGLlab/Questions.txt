1) I am inclined to believe this is called the: Graphics Processing Unit aka GPU

2)Host refers to the CPU and the threads, memory avaliable to it.

3)Device refers to the GPU and the thread, memory available to it.

4)The context is the: OS, hardware driver, hardware, and the windowing system

5)It is refered to as Heterogeneous Multiprocessing because it requires both
the CPU and the GPU in order to do it's computations. 

6) Noone

7) The framebuffer, in chapter 16, is directly related to the size of the
window that contains the graphics context. As well as containing both the
color and depth buffer. Where the color buffer contains the RGB A values of
the graphics and the depth buffer contains the information regarding the z
position of objects relative to one another.

8) To clear out the OpenGL display buffer you call
	glClearColor( 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)
	glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)

	If you wanted to clear the display buffer to all red you would do
	glClearColor( 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)
	glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)

9) For me the screen only changed color once, and the function glClearColor
was only called once in the glfwExample.cpp


10) In order to get the colors to change I had to open the file under
OpenGL/glfwExample.cpp. 
	In the while loop I changed some of the functionality so that it would
loop through the RGB values for each color increment of .001.
	In order to make it interactive I had to add a call to 
		glfwGetKey(....)
	which responds to user input.
